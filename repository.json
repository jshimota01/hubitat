			"description": "A need developed for me to be able to set Rules and automations within my Hubitat environment that would allow me to gain control seasonally. Originally, with community help I was able to build a Rule that would keep a Global Variable up to date. However this wasn't as smooth of a method. So I wrote this.  \nMeteorological Seasons of the Northern Hemisphere is a driver that provides, when installed correctly on a Hubitat platform, a selectable device driver. This driver, when used during creation of a virtual device, creates a clean way to bridge seasons to dashboard tiles, variables for Rules and other nice features  as well."
