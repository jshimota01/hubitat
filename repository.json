Meteorological Seasons is a driver that provides, when installed correctly on a Hubitat platform, a selectable device driver. This driver, when used during creation of a virtual device, creates a clean way to bridge seasons to dashboard tiles, variables for Rules and other nice features  as well.  Now useful for both hemispheres!"
