# hubitat

Heya - Jim here, you are in the Docs sub-folder of my storage of Hubitat related content.   Like many others I'm building and writing
drivers for use in my Home Automation (I use the Hubitat).

Inside feel free to browse and pick and choose anything you want - I'd appreciate an honorable mention if you use any snippets you find.
thanks!
